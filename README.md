# gdx-lava
A repository where I collect all the code that could be considered "generic". So, this might be my own implementation of a Utility AI library, my own Map Manager, my own take on how to do anything (like UI and bindings of ui elements). There is even a "SelectedItemList" included here. In time, one could dream, this could turn into a library that someone other than me could find useful. Until then, it is a way for me to share code between my "main" project and any game jam projects that I work on. This comes from my work on my first Game Jam where I learned so much and my code made leaps and bounds - and I realized copy and paste was not a viable strategy for transferring this knowledge between projects.
